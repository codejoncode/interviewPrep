# interviewPrep

The purpose of this repo is to peform the  hackerrank.com interview preparation kit.  I plan to implement solutions in either Python or Javascript and sometimes both in preparation for a technical interview for Python or a technical interview for Javascript. There are a total of 69 problems and I plan to go through each one without assurity of how long it will take but with hope that it will help me to be successful in the upcoming steps of looking for a job as a software engineer,  and or web developer.
